I recall watching one of the League of Legends World Championship finals, during an S-series tournament, where a professional esports player used Sylas near the mid-lane to steal Rakan's ultimate. This crucial play locked down the opposing team's double carries and secured the victory. Could you help me find out what that player's win rate with Sylas was throughout that entire S-series tournament?

(Note: League of Legends is a competitive multiplayer online game. Sylas and Rakan are playable characters, known as "champions," each with unique abilities.)
